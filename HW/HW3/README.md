## Description:
Discretize the numeric data into bins using unsupervised and supervised methods.
For this assignment we have used superrangeok.lua as a reference. We generate our own random numbers to be discretized. 



## Files:
1. List_Discretization.py  - calls Unsupervised range function and contains code for Supervised range
2. Range.py - Unsupervised ranges creation
3. Random.py - Generates random numbers
4. Num.py - Code for numeric values
5. Sample.py
 
 
## How to run:

* The code runs in Python 2.7
* For executing the code, enter the folder containing all the codes and type following in the terminal:

```
