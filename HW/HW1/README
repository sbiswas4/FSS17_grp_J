The program intends to read the csv file and maintain a list of lists to carry out the pre-processing steps.

The output file is written to 'ProcessedFile.txt' and 'ProcessedFile.csv'. The objective being that the ProcessedFile.txt file will let us know if data has been correctly typecasted to its column type while reading.

A logfile called 'log_file.txt' has been maintained to keep a record of rows formatted. It also informs us about the time it took to read , process and write the csv file given.

The file to be procesed must be put into 'file_to_be_preprocessed' variable under __main__. WE can also use file as an input arguement by uncommenting line 102 and commenting line 104.

The Preprocessor class has functions that preprocess the input file.

The read_input_file_and_convert_to_list function simple reads the file and makes a list of list 

The align_rows function handles unleft comma values. Eg from weather data: 
rainy,68,80,FALSE, 
       50,30
       
The white_space_removal function removes whitespaces

remove_comments removes comments after # and white spaces before # in a cell

remove_extranous_attribute_and_type_caste_numeric_values will remove values of cell with header starting with ? . It will also type caste values with headers with $ in them as float(numeric). This will also delete rows with non numeric values where numeric values should have been

detect_wrong_number_of_cell will detect and delete rows with wrong number of cells  

NOTE: Our last few lines of POM3A csv have error rows which get handled and logged
