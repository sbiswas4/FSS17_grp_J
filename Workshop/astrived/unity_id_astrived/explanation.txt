q)Explore the effects for different K in K Nearest Neighbor classification.
q)Explain how we should choose K.
q)Explore different kernels of Support Vector Machine.
q)Explian how we should choose the kernel



1)As we increase the number of K the cluster becomes more accurate in terms of capturing data points from the same class.
However a very large k will include data points from other classes(see k=100 graphs)

2)To begin with k could be sqrt(n),where n is the number of datapoints. 
We could try iterations of k from thereon to see what k gives lowest error on test set. 

3) The complex kernels capture the non-linearity of the data set as the classification boundary is not a line(rather curvy).

4) Depending if the data set is linearly seperable or not, we must employ kernels for classifications. "Rbf","polynomial"
