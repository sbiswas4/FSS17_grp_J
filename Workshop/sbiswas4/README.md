##Choosing K 

At very low K we see the phenomenon of overfitting as the model tries to fit every point. So it may happen that even the outliers are looked upon as 'normal' points. 

On the other hand large values of K give rise to bias where small groups of points are overlooked because of larger number of neighbours and these small groups are misclassified. 

To get best K cross validation should be performed with varying values of K and checked which gives the best accuracy. 



##Choosing Kernel  

The 3 types of kernels: linear, poly, rbf gives three different decision boundaries.
